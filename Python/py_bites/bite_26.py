# A dictionary comprehension is like a list comprehension, but it constructs
# a dict instead of a list. They are convenient to quickly operate on each
# (key, value) pair of a dict. And often in one line of code, maybe two after
# checking PEP8 ðŸ˜‰
#
# We think they are elegant, that's why we want you to know about them!
#
# In this Bite you are given a dict and a set. Write a dictionary comprehension
# that filters out the items in the set and returns the resulting dict, so if
# your dict is {1: 'bob', 2: 'julian', 3: 'tim'} and your set is {2, 3}, the
# resulting dict would be {1: 'bob'}.
#
# Check out the tests for more details. Have fun!
